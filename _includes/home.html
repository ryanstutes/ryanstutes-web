            <p>Hey &#128075; I'm Stutes!</p>
            <p>I'm an engineering leader with a breadth of experience in full-stack mobile and web development; I've always worked closely with my peers in product, design, data, platform, marketing, and more, so I have an impressive ability to communicate and work with a variety of audiences. I'm very well-organized and my two favorite things to nerd out about are coaching/feedback and system architecture.</p>
            <p>I enjoy working on products that have a positive social impact and diversity (with an emphasis on belonging) and autonomy (balanced with processes) are very important to me wherever I work. I'm a very open and direct communicator, I'm great at building trust and relationships, and I simply like to have fun and get stuff done!</p>
            <p>Looking for an engineering leadership role where I can use my unique combinaton of technical and people skills to drive business goals and scale the tech by building and maintaining <i>solid</i> teams and products.</p>

                    <p>I live in Chicago with my partner and our two dogs. I like to hike, camp, kayak, ski, walk my dogs (read: be outside), listen to podcasts, play video games, and learn new things. I have a passion for people and strive to spend a most of my energy on things that make people's lives better.</p>
